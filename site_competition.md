# What is a Competition?

Competitions provide a way to improve and increase publicity through consumer and audience interaction.


## How it works
-The audience uploads meadia submissions, then vote on which submissions move on to the next round.  This will ultimately lead to a final round where a winner is chosen.


## Key Features
-Competetiors submit original videos or images of their own creation as competition entries.  These entries are submitted through the Gigg Competitions website
-The audience votes on entries to determine the winner(s) of the round
