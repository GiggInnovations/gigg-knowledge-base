## General Challenge Rules

### TO ENSURE CHALLENGE/CAMPAIGN SUCCESS, YOU MUST HAVE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:
- Your business/personal social follower count must have a collective following of 500k+ with an ERR rate of AT LEAST 2%.
- An email list of 250k+ with an open rate of AT LEAST 20%.
- A social media influencer(s) with a collective social following of 500k+ with an ERR rate of AT LEAST 2%.
- A budget set aside for Gigg to recruit an influencer(s) with the above social reach and engagement (budget amount TBD and there is a Gigg fee associated with finding influencer(s).
- A budget set aside to help promote/boost/market the campaign on all proper social channels (budget amount TBD). Gigg also offers a paid option to send emails to a specific target audience as well as share on its social channels.

 **Engagement rate by reach** - (ERR) The measure of how well your social post performs relative to the number of people that interacted with it.

### ADDITIONAL RULES FOR CAMPAIGNS:

- Always have a voter prize.
- Video content will almost always perform better than static images if the desired outcome is for general awareness and voter engagement.
- It’s way more difficult to create virality than use what’s already viral.
- Remember that you are trying to mobilize your followers and entertain/educate their followers and fans.
- Every non-social challenge type needs a banner ad.
- If you have video ad opportunities, always use them.
- The challenge does not need to be directly connected to a use of the brand/product, but should be as closely related to the brand’s essence as possible.
- Example: If the client is Ooni pizza ovens, you don’t need to say “Show us your best Ooni pizza.”  It might also be valuable to say “Ooni can cook pizzas in under a minute. What talent do you have that you can show off in under a minute?”  In this scenario, your challenge will appeal to those who do not yet have an Ooni and would likely reach a much broader audience, while still informing the visitors how quickly Ooni can cook a pizza.

## Comment Challenges

### Overview
The purpose of a Comment Challenge is to increase social following, brand recognition and customer/follower engagement. They are also used to gather emails in exchange for discount codes.  Comment challenges require very little out of the customer and are great ways to get users engaged in preparation for a larger site competition


- Strengths: Comment challenges are easy to set up and are open to as much or as little design/production from the customer. They are also very easy for participants to enter. The Gigg software is linked with a social post from the client and the software will select a winner. We can also connect the post with a chatbot that will respond to comments and DM participants exclusive offers. 
- Weaknesses: This challenge type requires very little engagement on the part of the participant and there is no ability to expand reach through the use of voters. The challenge also typically has a short entry window, opening the possibility for contestants to typically miss the post altogether.

## Site Competition

### Overview
The purpose of a Site Challenge is to increase site traffic, brand recognition and create good User Generated Content. 

- Strengths: Site Challenges are versatile and can be used in many different ways. You get to decide how long the submission and voting period are. There is the capability to select multiple winners, by social votes and/or company choice. It is possible to pre-seed the challenge with entries you want people to vote on. The Challenge Admin is responsible for getting all assets from clients, etc. This Challenge type accepts branding/video ads as part of the setup process. 

- Weaknesses: The Site Challenges do take more time and effort from the company and/or influencer to setup. With all of the necessary assets, it is important to have enough time to get everything together to execute the Challenge. These types of challenges also require more budget when deciding on prizes for both contestants and voters. Gigg will provide suggestions, but the Challenge Admin will ultimately decide on prizes, etc. 


### Details
- There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to Site Challenges. Challenge Admins will select the length of the submission time period and voting. There can be multiple rounds of voting. Depending on what the contestant needs to submit and the quality of the prize, the time period and number of rounds will vary challenge to challenge. Gigg will give recommendations of what we think is best for the specific challenge. 

- For example, if we have a contest where people are asked to record a song, this submission period will be longer than a contest where people are asked to submit a picture of nature. If the barrier of entry is lower, we might recommend more rounds of voting, and different durations for rounds. 

- Ultimately, there are lots of variations you can do with a Site Challenge. When setting these up, we recommend working closely with the CS team to understand what is best for your upcoming Challenge.

## Note
Campaigns are treated the same as competitions and challenges.  All 3 are synonomous
