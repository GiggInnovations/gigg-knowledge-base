# Voting Rounds and Winner(s)

During the voting rounds, the public votes for which entries they liked the most. 

## How it works
-In each voting round, fewer and fewer entries are allowed to advance.  This continues until the final voting round when the winner(s) are decided by most votes.
-There is a minimum of one voting round and no maximum to the amount of voting rounds.  If there is just one voting round, the winner(s) will be whoever has the most votes after that round.


## User actions
-Once the voting round has begun, the entries that have been approved will appear on the Gigg challenge website. Each entry has its own tile.  Clicking on a tile will open a popup with the submission media.  Arrows to the left and right allow the user to scroll through all entries while remaining in the popup view.  
-To vote, the user clicks on an entry, causing the popup to open.  To the right of the media is a button reading "Vote for {Submission Namme}".  Clicking this button will cause it to turn green and count one vote for that submission.
-Once the last voting round has ended, the admin needs to press the "Advance Challenge" round.  This will cause an email to be sent to the entrant who received the  most votes for their submission.  The challenge will end.
