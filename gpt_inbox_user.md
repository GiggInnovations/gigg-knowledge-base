# Inbox Overview

The inbox is where posts from YouTube, Instagram, X (Twitter), and RSS feeds are collected and managed.  Takes place in Gigg.

## Setup Instructions

### Social Media Posts

1. Go to `Inbox Settings > Connections` and log into your social accounts
2. Go to `Inbox Settings > General` and enter 1–3 keywords (at least one is required)
3. Posts matching the keywords will start to appear, organized by keyword row

### RSS Feeds

- Add RSS links in `Inbox Settings > Feeds`
- All posts from the feed are shown (not filtered by keyword)

## Managing Posts

You can take the following actions on posts:

- 🗑 **Delete** — Click the trash icon
- 📌 **Pin** — Click the pin icon to add to one or more boards
- 🚫 **Block** — Click the prohibition icon to stop seeing posts from a user
- 🌀 **Post to Circle** — If Circle is connected, click the "C" icon to share to spaces
- ☑️ **Multi-Select** — Use checkboxes on the left to delete, pin, or block multiple posts at once

## Searching & Filtering

- Use the **search bar** to filter by:
  - Social platform (e.g., Instagram)
  - Keywords
  - Post content
- Use the **funnel icon** in the top right to sort by:
  - Pinned, Unpinned, or All
  - Newest or Oldest

## Why Block a User?

Blocking hides all future posts from a specific social media user.

Common reasons to block:
- Their posts are off-topic
- They post spam or low-quality content
- You want to exclude competitors
- You're curating a high-quality board

## Other Notes

- Posts are auto-sorted by **newest and unpinned**
- To unblock someone: go to `Inbox Settings > Inbox > Blocked Social Accounts` and click the trash icon
- The inbox auto-refreshes with new content — no need to reload manually
- You’ll see an icon on each post indicating if it came from social media or RSS
