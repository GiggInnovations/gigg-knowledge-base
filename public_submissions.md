# Public Submissions

Public Submissions are posts made by filling out a form, which are aggregated in the social inbox.


## Key Features
-The form can be filled out to allow the public to enter posts without using social media
-The public submission form can be easily embedded into a website


## How it works
-Toggles are used to change what is displayed/required on the form. A URL link can be shared to access the form on its own website
-In Inbox Settings>Public Submission, there is a UI about halfway down titled "Public Submission Form Embed Code". There is a button to "Copy Embed Code". Clicking this button copies the iframe code to the clipboard. Embedding this code will allow the public submission form to be filled out directly from the client's website. As the toggles change in Public Submission, the form changes with it, even if it has already been embedded.


## User Actions
-Navigate to Inbox Settings>Public Submission to view all public submission settings
-The first UI is the URL to the public submission page with an option to copy it to the clipboard
-The "Heading" UI has a textbox that allows the admin to type in a new heading for the form
-"Description" has a textbox where a description of the form can be typed. This will display underneath the header if used.
-"Submission Terms" allows the admin to write their own terms and conditions for submitting media via the form. This text shows up when clicking the check box on the actual form to accept the terms and conditions.  There is a default terms and conditions message written.  It will be displayed if the text box is blank but the terms and conditions is toggled on.
-"Image" has a dedault image of the Gigg icon.  It can be deleted and replaced with another image.  This image will appear at the top of the form.
-"Public Submission Form Embed Code" has a copy button.  Clicking this button copies the iframe code to the clipboard.  This can then be used to embed  the public submission form iframe into a website.
-"Form" has a list of toggles with options of "visible" and "required". A toggle cannot be required without being visible.  If toggled off, the associated field will not be visible on the form or not be required.  The fields that can be toggled are: Name, Message, Media, Email, Phone, Terms
-"Custom CSS Overrides" allows the admin to change the colors and style of the form by adding their own CSS code.  Available Gigg variables are listed next to the text box
