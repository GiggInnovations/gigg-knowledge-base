- Click **Display Board** and select one of three views: Standard, Carousel, or Masonry
- A `</>` button will appearâ€”click to copy the iframe code
- Paste the iframe into your website to display the board

## Embedding Public Submission Form

- Scroll to the section titled **Public Submission Form Embed Code**
