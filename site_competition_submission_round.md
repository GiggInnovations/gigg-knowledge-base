# What is a Competition?

Competitions provide a way to improve and increase publicity through consumer and audience interaction.


## How it works
- The audience uploads meadia submissions, then vote on which submissions move on to the next round.  This will ultimately lead to a final round where a winner is chosen.


## Key Features
- Competetiors submit original videos or images of their own creation as competition entries.  These entries are submitted through the Gigg Competitions website
- The audience votes on entries to determine the winner(s) of the round


## Audience interaction in each round
- After the competition has been published and before the competition begins, the competition website will only contain a timer counting down until the competition starts.
- During the first round, or submission round, entrants can submit media through the competition website.  The admin can either accept or reject the entries in the "Submissions" view.  Rejecting an antry will trigger a popup where the admin needs to type a rejection message before rejecting the entry.  The entrant will receive this rejection message via email. There are four main interactive parts to the UI during the submission round:
  1. "See Prizes and Rules" causes a popup to appear with the description and rules of the competition. A video explaining the competition and asociated prize if the challenge creator chooses to include one.
  2. "Enter Challenge" triggers the appearance of a modal.
     i. The first step of the modal is prompting registry through Facebook, Gmail, or Email.  Registering through Facebook and Gmail redirect to their own websites.  This allows the user to login by signing into their Facebook or Gmail account.  Signing in through email prompts the user to sign in using the email and password associated with their Gigg account.  If they don't have one, there is an option to register for a Gigg account.
     ii. After signing in or registering, the next step is to fill out the "About Me" page.  The available/required fields will vary based on what the admin chooses to include while setting up the competition. If the user tries to press the "Next" button without filling out a required field, red text under the field will notify the user it must be filled out before moving on.
     iii. Once the form has been filled out, the "Submission" page is where the media is uploaded. The UI allows either dragging and dropping a file, or accessing the computers files to find the desired media.  The amount of media permitted per entrant depends on the "Media Limit per Submission" chosen by the competition admin during setup.  Above the spot where media is uploaded, there is text and a counter indicating the current amount of uploaded media and the maximum amount of media allowed.  Uploaded files can be removed by pressing the white "X" next to the uploaded file name. Once the files have been uploaded, press "Submit" to submit the entry form and attatched media.
     iv. Submitting the form will change the modal to display a confirmation message saying the entrant should receive a confirmation email.  The entrant will only receive this if they included their email in the submission.  The user can then either logout of the current account, or press "Add More Media" to upload additional media if the limit has not been reached.
  3. "Vote" during this stage just has text showing the date when voting will begin.  There is also a box that can be checked if the user wants to be notified when the voting stage begins.
  4. Under the title "Check Out Some Entries", users can view uploaded entries that have been accepted by the admin.
- After the submission round, the audience votes for their favorite submissions to move on to the next round.  The length of each round is chosen by the admin during the setup process.  After a round ends, the admin must press "Advance Round" for the next round to begin. This is found in the "Rounds" section. Each round allows less and less submissions to advance before finally choosing the winning entry(ies).  An email is sent to each entrant that makes it to the next round, and sent to the winner(s) after the last round is over.

-NOTE: Competitions are sometimes referred to as challenges, they are synonymous.
