# Site Competition: Voting & Winners

Voting rounds determine which competition entries move forward and who wins.

## Voting Flow

- Competitions can have one or more voting rounds
- Fewer entries advance with each round
- Final round determines winner(s) by most votes

## How to Vote

1. Click on an entry to open a popup with media preview
2. Use arrows to navigate between submissions
3. Click the green **Vote for [Entry Name]** button to cast a vote

## Winning & Advancement

- After each round, the admin clicks **Advance Challenge**
- Emails are sent to the highest voted entries
- After the final round, the challenge ends and winners are notified

## Notes

- Users can only vote during active voting phases
- Voting restrictions (e.g., one vote per user) depend on admin setup
