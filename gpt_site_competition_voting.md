# What is Voting & Winner Selection?

The voting phase allows the public to vote on their favorite competition entries. This determines which submissions advance and who wins the final round.

## How it works

- Each competition can include one or multiple voting rounds
- During each round, users vote on approved entries
- As rounds progress, fewer entries advance
- The final round determines the winner(s) based on total votes
- Admins can manually remove entries from any round to override vote-based outcomes

## Voting Behavior

- Users can vote on multiple entries unless “Single Vote per User” is enabled
- Votes cannot be changed once submitted
- Voting is tracked per user unless anonymous voting is enabled in settings

## Advancing Rounds

- When a voting round ends, the admin must manually click “Advance Challenge” in Gigg

- Votes reset for the next round
- A holding screen appears on the competition website stating that the next round will begin shortly

## Voting Restrictions

- If “Single Vote per User” is enabled  in Gigg, users can only cast one vote per round
- Other vote-based restrictions (e.g., subscription requirement) are controlled in the “Type” tab

## User Actions on Gigg Competiton Website

- Users visit the Gigg challenge website during an active voting round

## Winning

- If the winner of the round is selected by votes, the entrants with the most votes move on
- Round winners and final winners can also be selected by random choice or company choice. This will depend on what the company has chosen in the "Rounds" setup tab in Gigg.

- After the final round ends and “Advance Challenge” is clicked, an email is sent to the entrant(s) with the most votes
- The challenge ends and the winner(s) are determined
- Admins can remove entries from the current round to influence outcomes if needed
- However, entries that did not advance from previous rounds cannot be brought back
- Winner(s) are automatically displayed on the Gigg competition website once chosen

## Notes

- This same flow is followed by social site competitions.
- A competition is a challenge. They are completely synonymous.
