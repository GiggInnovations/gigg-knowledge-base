# What is Voting & Winner Selection?

The voting phase allows the public to vote on their favorite competition entries. This determines which submissions advance and who wins the final round.

## How it works

- Each competition can include one or multiple voting rounds
- During each round, users vote on approved entries
- As rounds progress, fewer entries advance
- The final round determines the winner(s) based on total votes
- Admins can manually remove entries from any round to override vote-based outcomes

## Voting Behavior

- Users can vote on multiple entries unless “Single Vote per User” is enabled
- Votes cannot be changed once submitted
- Voting is tracked per user unless anonymous voting is enabled in settings

## Advancing Rounds

- When a voting round ends, the admin must manually click “Advance Challenge”
- Votes reset for the next round
- A holding screen appears on the competition website stating that the next round will begin shortly

## Voting Restrictions

- If “Single Vote per User” is enabled, users can only cast one vote per round
- Other vote-based restrictions (e.g., subscription requirement) are controlled in the “Type” tab

## User Actions

- Users visit the Gigg challenge website during an active voting round
- Approved entries are displayed as tiles
- Clicking a tile opens a popup with the entry’s media
- Users vote by clicking the “Vote for {Submission Name}” button next to the media
  - The button turns green to confirm the vote
  - Arrows allow navigation between entries in the popup


## Winning

- After the final round ends and “Advance Challenge” is clicked, an email is sent to the entrant(s) with the most votes
- The challenge ends and the winner(s) are determined
- Admins can remove entries from the current round to influence outcomes if needed
- However, entries that did not advance from previous rounds cannot be brought back
- Winners are automatically displayed on the site once chosen
