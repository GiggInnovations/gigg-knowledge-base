# What is the Submission Round?

The submission round is the first phase of a Site Competition, where entrants upload their media entries through the Gigg Competitions website.

## How it works

- Before the competition begins, the website displays a countdown timer
- Once started, users can submit their media entries through a form-based flow
- Users must be signed in via Facebook, Gmail, or a Gigg account (email + password)

## Submission Flow

1. Click "Enter Challenge" to launch a submission modal
2. Sign in or register an account
3. Fill out the "About Me" form (fields vary based on admin settings; required fields must be completed to proceed)
4. Upload media (drag-and-drop or file browser)
   - A counter shows how many files are uploaded vs. the allowed limit
   - Users cannot exceed the media limit
   - If the limit is reached, the "Add More Media" button becomes inactive
5. Submit the form to complete the entry
   - A confirmation message appears on screen
   - If an email was provided, a confirmation email is also sent

## Key Notes

- Submission must be completed in one session. If the page is refreshed, only the login is retained.
- If the entrant does not provide an email, only the on-screen confirmation appears.
- Accepted entries will appear on the competition page under "Check Out Some Entries"
- Rejected entries are never publicly visible, but users can re-submit a new entry
- Admins can edit any entry after submission
- Entrants cannot revise their own submission after itâ€™s been submitted

## Admin Review

- Admins review submissions in the "Submissions" tab
- Each entry can be accepted or rejected
- Rejections require a personalized message that is emailed to the entrant

## User Interface Elements

- **See Prizes and Rules**: Opens a modal with challenge description, rules, and optional intro video
- **Enter Challenge**: Starts the entry process

- **Check Out Some Entries**: Displays accepted and visible entries
