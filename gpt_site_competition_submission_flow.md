# What is the Submission Round?

The submission round is the first phase of a Site Competition, where entrants upload their media entries through the Gigg Competitions website.

## How it works

- Before the competition begins, the website displays a countdown timer

- Once started, users can submit their media entries through a form-based flow
- Users must be signed in via Facebook, Gmail, or a Gigg account (email + password)

## Submission Flow

   ![Upload media](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d27acec-3bc1-472a-bc2e-aad072770506)

   - A counter shows how many files are uploaded vs. the allowed limit
   - Users cannot exceed the media limit
   - If the limit is reached, the "Add More Media" button becomes inactive
5. Submit the form to complete the entry
   ![Submitting the form](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d857c983-c304-4c1c-9af1-9fa35dadc204)

   - A confirmation message appears on screen
   - If an email was provided, a confirmation email is also sent

## Key Notes

- Submission must be completed in one session. If the page is refreshed, only the login is retained.
- If the entrant does not provide an email, only the on-screen confirmation appears.
- Accepted entries will appear on the competition page under "Check Out Some Entries"
- Rejected entries are never publicly visible, but users can re-submit a new entry
- Admins can edit any entry after submission
- Entrants cannot revise their own submission after itâ€™s been submitted

## Admin Review

- Admins review submissions in the "Submissions" tab
- Each entry can be accepted or rejected
- Rejections require a personalized message that is emailed to the entrant

## User Interface Elements

- **See Prizes and Rules**: Opens a modal with challenge description, rules, and optional intro video
- **Enter Challenge**: Starts the entry process
- **Vote**: Inactive until voting starts; includes a checkbox to opt-in for reminders
- **Check Out Some Entries**: Displays accepted and visible entries

## Notes

- Competitions and challenges are the same thing.  There is no difference.
- This is the same flow for submitting entries to a Social Site Competition.
