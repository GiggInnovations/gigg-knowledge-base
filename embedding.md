# Embedding 

An embed code for boards and for public submission forms allows these iframes to be embedded into a website.


## Key Features
- Embedding a board allows the board to be viewed on a website.  This can help showcase items and increase publicity.
- There are three different types of boards for a variety of media display.
- Embedding the public submission form allows the form to be accessible without leaving the client's website.


## How it works 


### Boards
- Once a board has been published, press the three horizontal dot menu button in the top left and click "Display Board". Select one of the three options, then a "</>" button will appear. Clicking this button copies the iframe code to the clipboard.

- Embedding this code into a website will display the board.  There is a preview option to see what the board will look like once it has been embedded.


### Public Submission Form
- In Inbox Settings>Public Submission, there is a UI about halfway down titled "Public Submission Form Embed Code".  There is a button to "Copy Embed Code".  Clicking this button copies the iframe code to the clipboard.

- Embedding this code will allow the public submission form to be filled out directly from the client's website.  As the toggles change in Public Submission, the form changes with it.
