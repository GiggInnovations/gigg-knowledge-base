# Client Success
**Onboarding New Business Clients**

---

## Overview
We would like to onboard every client, whether it is an influencer or company. This will help Client Success understand what the client is looking for and what sequence of contests we should set up the client with.

## Details

### Sales
- After a deal is completed, this form must be completed before passing off the client to CS. 
    - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKnp5I480II47sQ4qGFRw4J7Cc_pty3gKB1CnFsS0DYsG4pg/viewform
    - Please fill out the form to the best of your ability. This way CS knows what was talked about in the sales process and has information going into the onboarding call. 
- Once form is completed, send a Welcome Email to the Client including the CSM who will be managing the account. 
- CSM will keep sales updated with scheduled onboarding calls and when/if sales needs to continue to be involved. 

### Client Success
- Onboarding Call (Between 30-45 minutes)
    - This is more of a discovery call. 
    - Goal of this call: 
      - Result they want to see from using Gigg. Some examples are: Brand Awareness, UGC, Email list, etc.)
      - Any contest ideas they have. 
      - Understanding their customer base 
      - Know prize offerings, dates and any time restraints to contest
- Work with team to come up with a schedule
  - Work with the CS team to come up with a good schedule of launching campaign(s). This will differ between each client, what they are trying to accomplish and when they want to launch their first campaign. 
- Meet with the client again. Depending on the client, this could either be an email or a call. 

### Starting a Campaign with an Influencer
- Go through their current content and find out who has sponsored them in the past.
- Fill out the form for new campaigns.
- Tell the influencer that, at the beginning of the intro video, “We will be watching every entry”.

## Client Post-Mortem Call

A short, 30 minute meeting with the client that happens after a challenge has been completed.  The goal is to review the challenge statistics, discuss what went well and what could be done better, and come up with a time frame for the next challenge to be launched.

# Sales
**If it isn’t in HubSpot, it isn’t real. Kind of like “Pics or it didn’t happen”, but your pay depends on it.**

## Creating a Deal in HubSpot
Once the client has: 
  1. Expressed interest 
  2. Confirmed that they have budget and 
  3. Confirmed that timing is not an issue, then 

  A deal must be created in HubSpot. To do so: 
  - Search for the company in HubSpot. If the company does not exist, create it and include as much of the information as possible.
  - Create the deal in HubSpot
    - Give the deal a name other than the company name. Also include the month and year of the contract expiration.  
    - Ex) “3 Challenges - JULY 2024” or “Trick Shot Tour - August 2023”
  - Attach the deal to the Company.
  - Attach the correct contacts to both the company and to the deal.
  - Move the deal into the correct stage of the “Sales” pipeline.

## Passing a New Client Off to Client Success
Once the deal is closed: 

- Create a ticket with “[Company Name] - Onboarding” as the ticket name.  
- Assign it to your CS contact.
  - Ex) “Taylor Guitars - Onboarding” assigned to “Lexi Davis”.
- Schedule and attend a handoff call that includes the contacts from the company, your client success manager, and yourself. The call should cover the following topics:
  - Contract Terms (What they purchased)
  - Contract Scope of Work (if applicable)
  - Who the points of contact are for campaigns, billing, etc.
  - What the client’s desired outcome is while working with Gigg.
  - Any campaign ideas that have been discussed.






CS Only - Make sure to upload the contract and attach it to the deal.
For onboarding a client, create a ticket and mark it done once onboarding is complete.
