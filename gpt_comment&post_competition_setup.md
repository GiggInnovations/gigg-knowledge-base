### Type

Exact same as comment competitions except with the extra UI of **Recurring Schedule**

- Recurring schedule: A toggle (default off) that allows the post competition to be repeated either weekly or monthly. This is determined by a dropdown where the admin can choose "weekly" or "monthly".

## Removing/editing Submissions
- For post and comment competitions, submissions cannot be removed.
- Admins can edit the comment of a post competition by:
  1. Click on the desired post
  2. 

## Choosing Winners
If the winner of a post or comment competition is chosen by the company, this is done during the **Approve and notify Winners** Round after submissions.
![Winners Round](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e09280e1-1e5f-4fda-a36a-cb6df2654ca9)

It functions similar to approving/rejecting an entry during the Submissions round of a Site Competition.  A check mark and an X are visible on the right of the entry.  Clicking the check mark will select the comment as a winner, the "x" will mark it as rejected.
