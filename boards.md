# What is a Board?

A board is a collection of pinned posts that can be cast to a screen or embedded in a website, displaying the desired media and showcasing the hand-picked posts promoting your brand, company, or product.


## How it works
-Posts from the social inbox are pinned to a board.  This collection of posts can then be displayed in a variety of styles, as well as embedded into a website.


## Key Features
-Posts in the social inbox can be pinned to one or multiple boards.
-The board's easily accessible embed code can be acquired in order to embed the board into the user's own website in the standard, carousel, and masonry views.
-The "video display" option allows boards to be cast to a TV, where the pinned posts can be displayed all at the same time or one by one.
