# What is a Board?

A board is a collection of pinned posts that can be cast to a screen or embedded in a website. This will display the desired media and showcase the hand-picked posts promoting your brand, company, or product.


## How it works
-Posts from the social inbox are pinned to a board.  This collection of posts can then be displayed in a variety of styles, as well as embedded into a website.


## Key Features
-The board's easily accessible embed code can be acquired in order to embed the board into the user's own website in the standard, carousel, and masonry views.
-The "video display" option allows boards to be cast to a TV, where the pinned posts can be displayed all at the same time or one by one.
-Custom posts can be created and added to boards

-To view boards, click the "Boards" dropdown on the left panel.  The dropdown will then display a list of all the created boards, as well as the option to create a new board.  Click the board you want to view, and the inbox will instead display the posts pinned to the board.
-To create a board, click the "Boards" dropdown on the left panel.  The dropdown will then display a list of all the created boards, as well as the option to create a new board with the text "+ Create Board". Click "+ Create Board".  A modal prompting the entry of a board name will appear.  Enter the board name in the textbox and click "Create". The modal will disappear and a textbox reading "Board successfully created" will appear at the top of the screen.
-To create a custom post, first navigate to the desired board through the "Boards" dropdown.  Click the menu icon, where the first option in the side panel will be "Create Post".  This will open a form that can be filled out to create the custom post.  The option "Populate from URL" simply requires the user to enter a URL, from which an editable sample post is generated.  Other options are to upload an image or video, add a caption, or add a link to a website.  Once the form has been filled out, scroll to the bottom and click the "Create" button in the bottom left of the side panel.  This custom post will appear as the first post at the top of the board. Unpinning this post from the board will move it to the "unpinned" inbox view.
-To publish a board, first navigate to the desired board.  In the top right of the board view, there is a menu icon of three vertical dots.  Click on this, and a panel will appear on the right side of the screen, where a button reading "Publish" should be present.  Click this button, then the button will momentarily turn green with a check mark in the middle, after which it will then turn gray with the text "Unpublish".
-Once a board has been published, click "Display Board". Select one of the three options, then a "</>" button will appear. Clicking this button copies the iframe code to the clipboard. Embedding this code into a website will display the board.  There is a preview option to see what the board will look like once it has been embedded.
