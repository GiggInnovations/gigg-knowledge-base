# Pinning Posts

Pinning allows users to organize important content from the inbox into curated boards for easy access and display.

## Key Features

- Pin to one or multiple boards
- Pin multiple posts at once

## How It Works

- Hover over a post and click the pin icon on the right
- If no custom boards exist, the post will pin to the default "Pinned" board
- If boards exist, a dropdown will appear with all board options:
  - Click a board name to pin directly
  - Or select multiple boards via checkboxes, then click **Apply**
- Once pinned, a "Successfully pinned" message appears and the post disappears from the inbox view

## Bulk Pinning

- Click the checkbox on the left side of each post
- Use the pin icon at the top of the inbox to pin selected posts
- Select one or more boards to complete the pinning process

## Viewing Pinned Posts

- Click the **Boards** dropdown on the left sidebar
- Select a board to view its pinned posts

## Notes

- The inbox defaults to showing unpinned posts
- Use the filter icon in the inbox to switch between:
  - Pinned
  - Unpinned
  - All
