# Public Submissions

Public Submissions allow anyone to contribute posts without using social media, through a customizable form that can be embedded on a website.

## Key Features

- Bypass social platforms—submissions via a public form
- Embeddable iframe for direct website integration

## How It Works

- Enable and configure the form in `Inbox Settings > Public Submission`
- Share the URL directly or use the embed code to insert the form on your site
- Toggles control which fields are visible or required (e.g., name, email, media)
- Edits to the form apply in real-time—even if already embedded

## Customization Options

- **Heading**: Title displayed at the top of the form
- **Description**: Optional subtext below the heading
- **Terms**: Custom terms & conditions with optional default message
- **Image**: Upload a custom image to appear at the top
- **Embed Code**: Copy iframe to embed the form on any site by clicking **Copy Embed Code** button
- **Form Fields**:
  - Visibility and requirement toggles for Name, Message, Media Type, Email, Phone, and Terms
  - Media field supports images, videos, or both

- **CSS Overrides**: Apply custom styles using predefined Gigg variables

## User Actions

- Copy the public form URL or embed code
- Customize headers, descriptions, terms, and image
- Choose which form fields to show or require
- Save changes to apply instantly across all embed locations
- Press the "x" in the top right corner of a logo to delete it before adding a new one
