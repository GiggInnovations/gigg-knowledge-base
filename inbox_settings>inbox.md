# Inbox Settings > Inbox

Customize how your social inbox filters and displays posts.

## Adding and Deleting Words

Each filter (Keywords, Blocked Words, Required Words, Whitelisted Usernames) has its own section under **Inbox Settings > Inbox**. Use these steps to add or remove items from any of these UIs (except **Blocked Social Accounts**, which behaves differently and is explained later).

- **Add a word:** Type the word into the text box and click **Add**. The word will appear below the text box.  
- **Add multiple words:** Enter one word per line (press **Enter** after each word) and click **Add**. Each word is added individually.  
- **Remove a word:** Click the trash can icon next to the word. A confirmation modal appears; choose **Remove** to confirm or **Cancel** to close it.

---

## Keywords

- Up to three keywords may be active at a time.  
- Add keywords one at a time by entering the word and pressing **Enter** or clicking **Add**.  
- Keywords trigger the pull of social media posts into the inbox.  
- Removing a keyword deletes all posts associated with it (pinned posts remain on boards).

---

## Blocked Words

- Posts containing blocked words are automatically deleted from the inbox. Pinned posts containing blocked words are also deleted.
- Removing a blocked word does not restore previously hidden posts unless the associated keyword is removed and re-added.  
- An **Offensive Text Filter** toggle (default: off) blocks posts containing words from a predefined list managed by Gigg.  
- **See [Offensive Text Filter Word List](#offensive-text-filter-word-list) below for the complete blocked words list.**

---

## Required Words

- Only social media posts containing required words will appear in the inbox.  
- Adjustments to required words require removing and re-adding the keyword to refresh results.  
- A separate **Required Feed Words** section applies this same filter to RSS feeds (social media required words do not affect feeds).

---

## Whitelisted Usernames

- Only posts from usernames in this list are pulled into the inbox.  
- Adjustments to the whitelist also require removing and re-adding the keyword to refresh results.

---

## Blocked Social Accounts

- When a user is blocked from the inbox, their username appears in this section.  
- Removing a blocked account allows future posts from that user to appear when keywords are re-added.  
- Blocked social accounts cannot be added manually; they must be blocked via posts in the inbox.

---

## Filter Interactions

- **Blocked Words** override all other filters, including whitelisted usernames.  
- **Required Words** and **Whitelisted Usernames** work together:  
  - If both filters are used, a post must meet **both** conditions to appear.  
- Only adding a keyword triggers a new pull of posts; changes to filters alone do not refresh existing content.
