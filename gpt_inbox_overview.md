# Inbox Overview

The inbox aggregates posts from YouTube, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and RSS feeds. These are organized and filtered based on user-defined keywords and settings.

## Creating a Social Inbox

New inboxes are created directly from the main dashboard. The setup steps mirror the options you’ll later find in **Inbox Settings**.

1. **Start Creation**  
   Click the **+ New** button in the top left, directly under the Gigg logo.  
   Select **Create Inbox** from the menu. A creation modal will open.                                                                                        ![Begin Inbox Creation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c31c974-fb71-4c47-8b6f-4934e2630fdc)


2. **Name Your Inbox**  
   Enter a name for the inbox.

   - **Next** moves to the next step.  
   - **Finish** creates the inbox immediately without any connections or feeds.  
   - **Cancel** stops the process at any time.  
   *Next and Finish are only available after entering a name.*

3. **Connect Accounts & Feeds**
   The next step mirrors the **Inbox Settings > Connections** and **Inbox Settings > Feeds** pages:  
   - **Connections**: Link Instagram, X (Twitter), or YouTube accounts. You can also add a Circle token to post from the inbox to Circle.                    ![Connections](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18332ef7-0a78-4606-a05f-a790664c5b40)                                                         
   - **Feeds**: Add or delete RSS feed URLs.                                                                                                                 <img width="961" height="623" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5343d6a5-6775-47ba-87d9-7c5996b7af3e" />
 
   Use **Back**, **Cancel**, or **Next** to navigate. *Next is only clickable after adding at least one social account or RSS feed.*                     

4. **Add Keywords**                                                                                                                                          <img width="961" height="714" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/719c2944-73ee-4cf6-a46b-0d3799c05816" />

   This step mirrors the **Inbox Settings > General** keyword setup.  
   Add 1–3 keywords (minimum of one) to pull in matching social posts.  
   Use **Back**, **Cancel**, or **Get Started**. *Get Started is only clickable after entering at least one keyword.*

5. **Finish & Open Inbox**  
   Clicking **Get Started** creates the inbox and opens it immediately, showing incoming posts that match your setup.


## Social Media Posts

- **Setup**:
    - Add credentials in `Inbox Settings > Connections`.

    - Then add 1–3 keywords in `Inbox Settings > General`. At least one keyword is required to pull in media. <img width="1905" height="503" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f935702c-fcea-48b9-b035-9ac1855dd16f" />

- **Display**: Top media per keyword shown.  Each post has its own row, posts are defaultly displayed based on how recently they were created.  There is no seperation based on keyword.
- **Actions**:
  - Delete posts
  - Pin to one or more boards
  - Block users
  - Filter via search bar (platform, keyword, or text)

## RSS Feeds

- **Setup**: Add RSS URLs in `Inbox Settings > Feeds`.
