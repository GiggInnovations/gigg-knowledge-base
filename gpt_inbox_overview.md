# Inbox Overview

The inbox aggregates posts from YouTube, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and RSS feeds. These are organized and filtered based on user-defined keywords and settings.

## Social Media Posts

- **Setup**: Add credentials in `Inbox Settings > Connections`. Then add 1–3 keywords in `Inbox Settings > General`. At least one keyword is required to pull in media.
- **Display**: Top media per keyword is shown in individual rows.
- **Actions**:
  - Delete posts
  - Pin to one or more boards
  - Block users
  - Filter via search bar (platform, keyword, or text)

## RSS Feeds

- **Setup**: Add RSS URLs in `Inbox Settings > Feeds`.
- **Display**: Shows all posts from the feed, independent of keyword settings.
- **Actions**: Same as social media posts—delete, pin, and search.

## Filtering and Sorting

- **Search Bar**: Filter by keyword, platform, or post content
- **Sort Options**: Use the funnel icon in the top right:
  - Posts: Pinned, Unpinned, All
  - Sort by: Newest, Oldest

## User Actions

- **Delete Post**: Hover right, click trash can
- **Pin Post**: Hover right, click pin icon
- **Block User**: Hover right, click prohibition symbol
- **Post to Circle**: If connected, use Circle icon and choose spaces
- **Multi-Select**: Click checkbox on left; bulk delete, pin, or block
- **Unblock User**: Go to `Inbox Settings > Inbox > Blocked Social Accounts`. Click trash icon and confirm removal. Posts will reappear after removing and re-adding the keyword.

## Defaults

- Posts are shown in chronological order
- Initial view shows unpinned and newest posts
